# Application Description

The bus schedule checking application is a personal project developed during the 3rd semester of studies in Swift. It allows users to check bus schedules conveniently on their iPhone and iPad devices. The entire backend database structure is personally created using Firebase. The app provides users with up-to-date information on bus routes, timings, and stops.

## Key Features

- Calculate distances from the user's current location to selected bus stops.
- Dynamic adjustment of departure times to display only buses reachable by the user based on their current location and estimated travel time.
- Save favorite routes and stops for quick access.
- Seamless compatibility with both iPhone and iPad devices.

## Future Developments

In the future, the application aims to expand its compatibility to include a widget version for MacBook, utilizing a PostgreSQL database. This enhancement will further enhance accessibility and convenience for users across different Apple devices.
